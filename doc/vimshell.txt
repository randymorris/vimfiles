INTRODUCTION					*vimshell-introduction*

==============================================================================
USAGE						*vimshell-usage*

You can start vimshell in ":VimShell".  Because vimshell works similar with
a common shell, you may operate it intuitively.  But vimshell perform the
path appointment in '/'. Vimshell is misunderstood with escape sequence when
you use '\' by Windows for a path and do not work.
